Bob have the same photo?

- Yeah, I'm gonna live.

636
00:43:21,626 --> 00:43:23,091
Two of my guys didn't make it.

637
00:43:23,093 --> 00:43:24,849
You know that? They have families.

638
00:43:24,851 --> 00:43:27,015
They'll be taken care of.
There's an Agency slush fund.

639
00:43:27,017 --> 00:43:29,749
That was a very dirty job,
even for the Agency.

640
00:43:29,751 --> 00:43:32,247
We need to stay focused and
just wipe everything down.

641
00:43:32,249 --> 00:43:33,847
Yeah.

642
00:43:33,849 --> 00:43:36,027
- Where did you get the ambulance?
- Rented it.

643
00:43:36,029 --> 00:43:39,499
- You rented it?
- I told them we were making a movie.

644
00:43:39,501 --> 00:43:42,327
- Did you use your real name?
- You said to go fast.

645
00:43:42,329 --> 00:43:44,624
It was too fast. I told you that.

646
00:43:44,626 --> 00:43:46,851
And that boy of yours,
he had real skills.

647
00:43:46,853 --> 00:43:49,165
You said it was an easy job.
That was not an easy job.

648
00:43:49,167 --> 00:43:53,167
- I got bad intel.
- Who the fuck was that guy?

649
00:43:53,169 --> 00:43:55,585
(SIGHS) Russian intelligence officer.

650
00:43:56,831 --> 00:43:58,832
(CHUCKLES)

651
00:43:58,834 --> 00:44:02,998
- Your friend. The one who's alive.
- Yeah, let's see him.

652
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,390
Do you trust him?

653
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:07,707
Is he gonna tell anyone my name?

654
00:44:07,709 --> 00:44:10,250
He doesn't know your name.

655
00:44:11,531 --> 00:44:13,500
Where's the burner we've been using?

656
00:44:14,892 --> 00:44:16,892
Hold on.

657
00:44:22,571 --> 00:44:24,411
The agency better fucking
take care of their...

658
00:44:24,413 --> 00:44:26,413
(GUNSHOTS)

659
00:44:26,415 --> 00:44:28,415
(BODY THUDS)

660
00:44:32,361 --> 00:44:34,361
(GUNSHOT)
