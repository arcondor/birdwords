1
00:00:00,167 --> 00:00:01,640
Previously on "Condor"...

2
00:00:01,642 --> 00:00:04,071
- He changed his mind, wants to help.
- Help how?

3
00:00:04,073 --> 00:00:07,182
He's going over the files.
He thinks Gordon's been set up.

4
00:00:07,184 --> 00:00:09,764
I have an asset inside the SVR.

5
00:00:09,766 --> 00:00:11,680
A week ago he passed me a file

6
00:00:11,682 --> 00:00:14,672
indicating that Gordon Piper was
working with the Russians.

7
00:00:14,674 --> 00:00:17,624
I can't do this anymore.
I feel like they know.

8
00:00:17,626 --> 00:00:19,251
When you contact the CIA,

9
00:00:19,253 --> 00:00:22,165
you must not say that I helped you.

10
00:00:22,167 --> 00:00:25,582
I need to ask you for one last favor.

11
00:00:25,584 --> 00:00:29,092
I'm suggesting that the mole's
treachery is getting people killed...

12
00:00:29,094 --> 00:00:31,893
... and causing other damage in
ways we cannot begin to know.

13
00:00:31,895 --> 00:00:34,230
So as much as we may dislike
each other personally...

14
00:00:34,232 --> 00:00:36,332
I don't have a personal
opinion about you.

15
00:00:36,334 --> 00:00:38,702
So as much as I dislike you personally,

16
00:00:38,704 --> 00:00:41,457
I showed you my report
in the spirit of openness.

17
00:00:41,459 --> 00:00:43,488
This is the same photo
from Bob's office.

18
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:44,938
And you can plant fake files,

19
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,066
but how do you make an
innocent man take a payoff?

20
00:00:47,068 --> 00:00:49,804
Gordon took money from a
Russian intelligent agent.

21
00:00:49,806 --> 00:00:52,157
- No more waiting.
- I agree. Just...

22
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:53,832
Can you do me a favor?

23
00:00:53,834 --> 00:00:55,749
The pizza's here.

24
00:00:55,751 --> 00:00:58,075
I asked them to let me be
the one to come and get you.

25
00:00:58,077 --> 00:00:59,682
Tracy, I don't know what
the fuck you're talking about.

26
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:02,249
Lior Lishkott. You took money from him.

27
00:01:02,251 --> 00:01:03,823
The Americans will be looking for you.

28
00:01:03,825 --> 00:01:05,419
You are going to have
to go away for a while.

29
00:01:05,421 --> 00:01:07,688
How long do I have to go away for?

30
00:01:11,157 --> 00:01:13,157
- The ambulance.
- What ambulance?

31
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:15,248
How'd they get it?

32
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,590
- Where'd you get the ambulance?
- Rented it.

33
00:01:17,592 --> 00:01:18,853
Your friend...

34
00:01:18,855 --> 00:01:21,371
the one who's alive. Is he
going to tell anyone my name?

35
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:23,107
He doesn't know your name.

36
00:02:03,197 --> 00:02:08,697
- Synced and corrected by<font color="#00BFFF"> Firefly</font> -
- <font color="#00ffff">www.addic7ed.com</font> -

37
00:02:20,155 --> 00:02:21,556
Yeah.

38
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,101
Hi.

39
00:02:23,103 --> 00:02:26,316
There's been a development I
thought you'd want to know about.

40
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:29,499
- Gordon's been picked up.
- Okay.

41
00:02:29,501 --> 00:02:32,918
- I'll come meet you.
- I'm out front.

42
00:02:46,918 --> 00:02:50,127
I feel terrible for
what I've done to him.

43
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:53,081
You didn't do anything
to him. You defended him.

44
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:54,808
That's what I keep telling myself.

45
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:57,790
This is on Gordon.
You're not responsible.

46
00:02:57,792 --> 00:02:59,778
I keep telling myself that, too.

47
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,832
And it was his decisions
that led him here.

48
00:03:01,834 --> 00:03:05,412
But, I didn't try and help him.
I saw him getting worse.

49
00:03:05,414 --> 00:03:10,416
The drinking and the money problems
and the fights with Eva...

50
00:03:10,418 --> 00:03:14,316
He was hurting. I didn't reach out.
I did the opposite.

51
00:03:15,098 --> 00:03:17,065
You should have seen the way

52
00:03:17,067 --> 00:03:19,123
Eva looked at me when I
walked him out of the house.

53
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:23,709
Like she wanted to kill me. His kids...

54
00:03:25,751 --> 00:03:30,081
If Gordon is innocent, we
will have a chance to prove it.

55
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:34,749
- Has he said anything?
- Mm. Completely isolated.

56
00:03:34,751 --> 00:03:37,577
Robin's gonna let him sit overnight...

57
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:39,293
and question him in the morning.

58
00:03:40,735 --> 00:03:42,443
I still believe that Gordon was set up.

59
00:03:46,334 --> 00:03:49,209
I don't know what I believe any more.

60
00:03:50,417 --> 00:03:52,145
Anything on the ambulance?

61
00:03:52,147 --> 00:03:55,207
They were still setting up
a spreadsheet when I left.

62
00:03:55,209 --> 00:03:58,583
All right. Well...

63
00:03:58,585 --> 00:04:00,125
'Til the morning.

64
00:04:42,918 --> 00:04:45,025
I've missed you, my friend.

65
00:04:45,027 --> 00:04:47,665
I wish the circumstances were better.

66
00:04:47,667 --> 00:04:50,673
No. At least it looks as though
your people have taken the bait.

67
00:04:50,675 --> 00:04:52,355
They're not my people.

68
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:54,759
There may still be a problem.

69
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,464
- Who?
- Joe Turner.

70
00:04:56,466 --> 00:04:57,981
He recognized the photo from the file

71
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,448
I planted in Partidge's office.

72
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:01,107
- He is smart.
- I'll handle it.

73
00:05:01,109 --> 00:05:03,790
No, if anything happened to Turner,
it'll only bring more heat.

74
00:05:03,792 --> 00:05:06,399
I'm keeping him close. He trusts me.

75
00:05:06,401 --> 00:05:08,187
If it needs to be done, I'll do it.

76
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:11,898
There's another loose end to tie.

77
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,372
The guy we used for
the Sirin job, Dan Letts...

78
00:05:14,374 --> 00:05:16,457
I don't think he could ID me, but...

79
00:05:16,459 --> 00:05:18,042
Why take the chance?

80
00:05:19,709 --> 00:05:23,011
Any word from Moscow on
how Sirin found out about me?

81
00:05:23,013 --> 00:05:24,819
We're investigating.

82
00:05:24,821 --> 00:05:26,526
You're going to have to stay here.

83
00:05:26,528 --> 00:05:29,449
You've earned your retirement:
nice apartment in Moscow...

84
00:05:29,451 --> 00:05:32,351
dacha in the country,
money, whatever you want.

85
00:05:34,068 --> 00:05:38,342
The timing's not good. I've met someone.

86
00:05:39,501 --> 00:05:44,248
- I'm thinking about getting out.
- Getting out?

87
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:49,560
- You could be seen as a liability.
- Is that a threat?

88
00:05:49,562 --> 00:05:51,629
Not by me.

89
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:57,836
- You think I'm gonna become a triple agent?
- The risk...

90
00:05:57,838 --> 00:06:00,223
I don't have any reason
to say anything to anybody...

91
00:06:00,225 --> 00:06:01,582
... and every reason not to.

92
00:06:01,584 --> 00:06:04,768
When we first met, you were
a man with thwarted ambitions...

93
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,889
... and a burning desire
to do something great.

94
00:06:06,891 --> 00:06:10,599
That never goes away,
even if it goes dormant for a while.

95
00:06:13,387 --> 00:06:18,304
I'm not that man anymore.
I want a simple life now.

96
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,157
Moscow may not allow it.

97
00:06:21,159 --> 00:06:23,832
Why does Moscow care where I retire?

98
00:06:23,834 --> 00:06:26,410
If you were in Moscow,
you could let the world know...

99
00:06:26,412 --> 00:06:29,290
... the extent of our
penetration into the CIA.

100
00:06:29,292 --> 00:06:31,345
That in itself is a
public relations coup.

101
00:06:31,347 --> 00:06:33,032
This isn't about Moscow.

102
00:06:33,034 --> 00:06:35,123
This is about you,
and you want the credit.

103
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:36,874
I want us to get the credit.

104
00:06:36,876 --> 00:06:40,794
All that work... all those years...

105
00:06:40,796 --> 00:06:42,316
What were they for?

106
00:06:53,019 --> 00:07:00,499
_

107
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:22,680
Is he okay?

108
00:07:22,682 --> 00:07:24,895
- Does he look okay?
- Shit, man.

109
00:07:24,897 --> 00:07:26,766
What the fuck happened?

110
00:07:31,767 --> 00:07:33,767
_

111
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:44,081
Where the fuck are you, dude?
If I call and I call, call me back!

112
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,087
I'm really fucking scared.

113
00:07:46,089 --> 00:07:48,919
I think... someone's watching me.

114
00:07:50,584 --> 00:07:52,292
Damn...

115
00:08:13,417 --> 00:08:15,375
Would you like some dessert?

116
00:08:17,484 --> 00:08:18,986
If you have any heart medication,

117
00:08:18,988 --> 00:08:20,792
now would be the time to take it.

118
00:08:28,292 --> 00:08:30,501
Do you have to get that?

119
00:08:34,324 --> 00:08:38,826
Well, it's just my assistant.
She's, uh... checking up on me.

120
00:08:38,828 --> 00:08:41,039
I'll call her in the morning.

121
00:08:46,136 --> 00:08:49,046
So would you like to
see the rest of the house?

122
00:08:50,385 --> 00:08:53,119
I don't believe you've
been upstairs yet.

123
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:56,667
I'd like that very much.

124
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:24,609
- Does that feel good?
- Oh, yeah...

125
00:09:32,792 --> 00:09:36,375
- Are you expecting someone?
- No.

126
00:09:44,596 --> 00:09:47,981
- Hi, Carla.
- Sorry to show up unannounced.

127
00:09:47,983 --> 00:09:50,024
- I tried calling a few times.
- What's wrong?

128
00:09:50,026 --> 00:09:52,589
I got a call from a
contact over at the FBI.

129
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:56,431
Their embed at the CIMC has taken
one of our people into custody.

130
00:09:56,433 --> 00:09:57,438
Who?

131
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,862
Gordon Piper.

132
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,751
Oh, fucking hilarious!

133
00:10:38,348 --> 00:10:42,163
You think this is funny?
This shit could kill me!

134
00:10:43,626 --> 00:10:45,751
Fucking assholes!

135
00:11:09,459 --> 00:11:10,675
Come in.

136
00:11:12,542 --> 00:11:14,834
Watching anything good?

137
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:22,582
- Good morning.
- I thought you'd be happier to see me.

138
00:11:22,584 --> 00:11:25,496
You've just taken one of
my people into custody.

139
00:11:25,498 --> 00:11:28,332
A mole operating right
under my nose for years.

140
00:11:28,334 --> 00:11:31,380
What good is winning
if you don't get to gloat?

141
00:11:49,615 --> 00:11:52,540
Don't hurt me, I come in peace.

142
00:11:52,542 --> 00:11:55,375
I'm taking Jude to school.
Do you need a lift?

143
00:11:55,377 --> 00:11:58,252
- No, I'll ride my bike.
- Okay.

144
00:11:59,626 --> 00:12:02,081
Why are you all dressed up?

145
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,584
- I have an important meeting today.
- With who?

146
00:12:08,518 --> 00:12:10,998
I'm going to talk to someone
about Reuel Abbott.

147
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,125
I've been thinking
about what you said...

148
00:12:13,127 --> 00:12:14,528
... and if there's a way
to hold him accountable...

149
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:15,693
... for what he's done to this family...

150
00:12:15,695 --> 00:12:17,131
... I'm gonna see that it gets done.

151
00:12:17,133 --> 00:12:18,172
Good.

152
00:12:18,174 --> 00:12:20,764
I want you to promise me that
you're going to stay away from him.

153
00:12:20,766 --> 00:12:23,504
He's an evil old prick and I don't
know what he's capable of.

154
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,042
- Say it.
- I promise.

155
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:29,130
Okay.

156
00:12:35,143 --> 00:12:37,935
Oh. I'll get my camera.

157
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,068
You look nice when you want to.

158
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:43,209
I'm having lunch with a friend.

159
00:12:43,211 --> 00:12:44,916
Hmm.

160
00:12:44,918 --> 00:12:47,250
- I'm gonna go get ready for school.
- See you.

161
00:12:47,252 --> 00:12:48,552
Okay.

162
00:12:49,841 --> 00:12:52,559
Thought maybe you stayed
over at your lady friend's again.

163
00:12:52,561 --> 00:12:54,916
Oh, no, it was more
of a one-night thing.

164
00:12:54,918 --> 00:12:57,751
Well, you have a way of making
temporary things permanent.

165
00:12:59,426 --> 00:13:00,427
Yeah.

166
00:13:00,429 --> 00:13:01,855
- I'll see you later.
- See you.

167
00:13:07,792 --> 00:13:10,337
I'm waiting to hear back from them.

168
00:13:10,339 --> 00:13:12,374
We'll see you at the club.
I'm on my way.

169
00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:14,927
It's all about who you know...

170
00:13:19,459 --> 00:13:22,292
You sprung for the premium package, huh?

171
00:13:45,626 --> 00:13:47,147
This isn't like Tinder.

172
00:13:47,149 --> 00:13:48,876
You need references from two members

173
00:13:48,878 --> 00:13:51,241
and then there's this
whole approval process.

174
00:13:51,243 --> 00:13:55,035
- Jesus!
- Yeah, Jesus couldn't even get on this dating app, bro.

175
00:13:56,155 --> 00:13:57,156
Good morning.

176
00:13:57,158 --> 00:13:58,707
- Oh. Hey, man.
- Hey.

177
00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:01,043
This is an FBI matter now.
We're shutting down the site.

178
00:14:01,045 --> 00:14:03,181
Yeah, I know. I'm just wondering
how you got on with that ambulance.

179
00:14:03,183 --> 00:14:04,184
Ambulance?

180
00:14:04,186 --> 00:14:06,999
Yeah, we put together a
database of rental companies...

181
00:14:07,001 --> 00:14:08,583
- ... but that's about it.
- Can I get a copy?

182
00:14:08,585 --> 00:14:09,922
Well, the hard drives are packed away.

183
00:14:09,924 --> 00:14:11,790
You know we already got the guy, right?

184
00:14:11,792 --> 00:14:15,957
I know. But it's important.

185
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:19,167
- Yeah. I can find it for you.
- All right.

186
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:24,792
- Good morning.
- Hey.

187
00:14:30,584 --> 00:14:34,207
- Measuring your mark?
- I've got this one all sized up.

188
00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:36,596
He's not much different
than anyone else with a penis.

189
00:14:36,598 --> 00:14:38,263
Just a bit more extreme.

190
00:14:38,265 --> 00:14:39,500
Really?

191
00:14:39,502 --> 00:14:44,111
Deep down every man believes
in his own unique specialness.

192
00:14:44,113 --> 00:14:47,153
- I think it's a flaw in your gender.
- Thinking we're special?

193
00:14:47,155 --> 00:14:48,473
Thinking that your specialness

194
00:14:48,475 --> 00:14:51,290
has gone unrecognized by everyone else.

195
00:14:51,292 --> 00:14:55,474
That's why someone turns traitor.
To win back that specialness.

196
00:14:55,476 --> 00:14:57,874
If a spy is someone who keeps secrets...

197
00:14:57,876 --> 00:15:00,290
... a mole is someone who
keeps secrets from other spies.

198
00:15:00,292 --> 00:15:02,916
What could be more special that that?

199
00:15:02,918 --> 00:15:05,518
I'm going to break him.

200
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,703
I'm going to give him no choice...

201
00:15:07,705 --> 00:15:11,540
... but to defend himself with a
declaration of his own importance.

202
00:15:11,542 --> 00:15:14,584
He already looks pretty broken.
What are you waiting for?

203
00:15:15,626 --> 00:15:17,790
Reuel Abbott's in the building.

204
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:19,916
He had to step away for a few minutes.

205
00:15:19,918 --> 00:15:23,457
- I guess nothing stays a secret for long.
- Well, it's okay.

206
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:25,665
That way we get to kill
two birds with one stone.

207
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:28,626
- The other bird being?
- Him learning to fear me.

208
00:15:29,584 --> 00:15:33,379
- How are you doing?
- I feel a crippling guilt.

209
00:15:33,381 --> 00:15:34,874
But other than that, great.

210
00:15:34,876 --> 00:15:37,667
This isn't anybody's fault but Gordon's.

211
00:15:39,584 --> 00:15:41,417
I know.

212
00:15:55,709 --> 00:15:57,834
Thank you very much.

213
00:16:02,918 --> 00:16:05,021
Anyone good in this movie of yours?

214
00:16:05,023 --> 00:16:06,816
You know my nephew Sammy?

215
00:16:06,818 --> 00:16:08,355
Ah. So, it's a student film?

216
00:16:08,357 --> 00:16:11,957
That kid is amazing. He edits
all the effects on his laptop.

217
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:13,699
- Kids these days...
- Right.

218
00:16:13,701 --> 00:16:14,913
I just saw in the newspaper

219
00:16:14,915 --> 00:16:17,940
that a 12-year-old girl just got
into Harvard Medical School.

220
00:16:17,942 --> 00:16:19,040
Huh.

221
00:16:19,042 --> 00:16:21,000
- There she is.
- _

222
00:16:22,626 --> 00:16:26,811
- No, no, this is not what I'm looking for.
- It's an ambulance.

223
00:16:26,813 --> 00:16:30,373
Yeah. No, the kid's got
a real specific vision.

224
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:31,374
All right then.

225
00:16:31,376 --> 00:16:33,178
I myself am in between cars.

226
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,174
I don't suppose you've got
something I could rent, do you?

227
00:16:35,176 --> 00:16:38,050
Sure, we can scrounge you up a car.

228
00:16:38,052 --> 00:16:39,553
Cool.

229
00:16:42,026 --> 00:16:45,545
Sorry for the hold up.
Did I miss anything good?

230
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:47,248
No, she's waited for you.

231
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:50,499
You know, she wants to give me
a taste of my own fate, huh?

232
00:16:50,501 --> 00:16:53,280
Well, that's... that's at the
heart of any good drama,

233
00:16:53,282 --> 00:16:54,540
don't you think?

234
00:16:54,542 --> 00:16:59,577
Getting to imagine yourself
standing in somebody else's shoes...

235
00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:03,209
It's... I look forward to it, really.

236
00:17:03,211 --> 00:17:05,648
You have a lighter attitude
about this than I expected.

237
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:08,313
I do, don't I? I feel lighter.

238
00:17:10,376 --> 00:17:11,422
Robin?

239
00:17:12,751 --> 00:17:16,549
This has all been a giant...
giant misunderstanding.

240
00:17:16,551 --> 00:17:18,573
Lior Lishkott and I are
going into business together.

241
00:17:18,575 --> 00:17:19,576
It's all above board.

242
00:17:19,578 --> 00:17:21,902
I just couldn't report it up the
ladder until I was sure it was real.

243
00:17:21,904 --> 00:17:23,504
You understand that?

244
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:27,420
The money was just an
advance against my salary.

245
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:30,507
We were... going to lose the house.

246
00:17:35,133 --> 00:17:38,573
Are you going to... pull this
intimidation bullshit with me?

247
00:17:38,575 --> 00:17:40,499
The least you can do is,
show me a little dignity.

248
00:17:40,501 --> 00:17:43,273
How dignified is it to
take money from a man

249
00:17:43,275 --> 00:17:46,741
with direct ties to Russian
intelligence, Gordon?

250
00:17:46,743 --> 00:17:47,743
Bullshit.

251
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:54,665
It's all in there. Lior's business
is financed by the Kremlin.

252
00:17:54,667 --> 00:17:57,042
He's an SVR asset.

253
00:18:09,953 --> 00:18:12,742
I... I didn't know.

254
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:17,665
Right. You're just a spy.

255
00:18:17,667 --> 00:18:22,311
It's not like it's your business
to know such things.

256
00:18:22,313 --> 00:18:26,045
How many blown ops have
you been a part of recently?

257
00:18:26,047 --> 00:18:28,361
Belgrade, Dubrovnik...

258
00:18:28,363 --> 00:18:30,092
- the Ukrainian op last week.
- What?

259
00:18:30,094 --> 00:18:33,290
I mean, how much loss
of life and spilled blood

260
00:18:33,292 --> 00:18:36,037
- are we talking about here?
- Robin...

261
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:37,138
You know me.

262
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:40,957
I think we are well beyond
that assumption, Gordo.

263
00:18:40,959 --> 00:18:44,998
Look, I know how bad it looks, but
what's the logical explanation?

264
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,117
That I suddenly turned
against my country

265
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:49,125
after more than a
decade of loyal service...

266
00:18:49,127 --> 00:18:52,081
... or that I did
something fucking stupid?

267
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:54,542
Those aren't mutually
exclusive possibilities.

268
00:18:55,834 --> 00:19:00,832
And if I was to believe that
you were just stupid...

269
00:19:00,834 --> 00:19:03,540
... you'd have to be
pretty fucking stupid!

270
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:08,342
I swear. I am loyal.

271
00:19:16,709 --> 00:19:19,957
- More than a decade, huh?
- Yes.

272
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:22,301
What year did you join the Agency?

273
00:19:22,303 --> 00:19:23,714
Come on, you know the answer to that.

274
00:19:23,716 --> 00:19:27,800
You don't like my answers, so why
don't we start hearing yours?

275
00:19:31,042 --> 00:19:33,676
2005.

276
00:19:33,678 --> 00:19:36,303
- Why did you join?
- Robin...

277
00:19:36,305 --> 00:19:40,311
I'm trying to figure out where it
all went wrong for you, Gordon.

278
00:19:41,751 --> 00:19:44,499
Why did you join the CIA?

279
00:19:44,501 --> 00:19:48,496
Go back to being a kid, who
didn't know what their future was...

280
00:19:48,498 --> 00:19:50,706
... and who never could have imagined

281
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:52,751
where life was going to take him.

282
00:19:55,751 --> 00:19:58,707
- Jay Atwood?
- Are you the new waiter?

283
00:19:58,709 --> 00:20:00,746
- No, I...
- Okay, I was kidding.

284
00:20:00,748 --> 00:20:03,059
I can tell you're not the new waiter.
You're clearly American.

285
00:20:03,061 --> 00:20:04,506
Who are you? Why do I care?

286
00:20:04,508 --> 00:20:06,578
Your secretary said you'd be down here.

287
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,357
Said you don't spend
much time in the office.

288
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:11,457
This is my office and I've got a
twelve o'clock meeting, so...

289
00:20:11,459 --> 00:20:12,940
I'm your twelve o'clock.

290
00:20:12,942 --> 00:20:17,190
Your office... your other office
said you'd be expecting me.

291
00:20:17,192 --> 00:20:18,312
Tracy Crane...

292
00:20:21,161 --> 00:20:25,597
You're Tracy Crane. Ah, shit!

293
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,426
You were expecting a woman?

294
00:20:27,428 --> 00:20:30,852
Yeah... yeah, I was expecting a...

295
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:34,041
Got dressed up, showered and everything.

296
00:20:34,043 --> 00:20:37,346
Welcome to Athens. Jay Attwood.

297
00:20:37,348 --> 00:20:38,821
You hungry? You want some lunch?

298
00:20:38,823 --> 00:20:41,032
- Yeah, sure.
- Bring him the special...

299
00:20:42,459 --> 00:20:44,125
Sit down.

300
00:20:46,292 --> 00:20:48,727
The food here is excellent,

301
00:20:48,729 --> 00:20:51,780
but Athens station is
pure loukaniko party.

302
00:20:51,782 --> 00:20:53,460
- You know what a loukaniko is?
- No.

303
00:20:53,462 --> 00:20:54,592
Loukaniko is sausage.

304
00:20:54,594 --> 00:20:57,116
What I'm saying is that
Athens is a sausage party.

305
00:20:57,118 --> 00:20:59,309
I thought we were
getting some new talent.

306
00:20:59,311 --> 00:21:01,363
Sorry to disappoint.

307
00:21:01,365 --> 00:21:04,764
- So, is this your first posting?
- Yeah.

308
00:21:04,766 --> 00:21:08,214
Well, Athens is a good place
to pop your cherry.

309
00:21:08,216 --> 00:21:10,937
Maybe you'd rather pop her cherry? Huh?

310
00:21:10,939 --> 00:21:13,540
I'm married. We have a three year old.

311
00:21:13,542 --> 00:21:15,626
And the guy's got an
answer for everything...

312
00:21:21,042 --> 00:21:25,998
So? Why'd you join the you know what?

313
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,499
I'm talking about the CIA.

314
00:21:29,501 --> 00:21:32,413
To serve my country. Something
that's intellectually stimu...

315
00:21:32,415 --> 00:21:35,202
No, no, no. No, stop. Come on.
Don't give me the bullshit answer.

316
00:21:35,204 --> 00:21:37,874
- You already got the job.
- I was... I'm not...

317
00:21:37,876 --> 00:21:42,050
Come on. When you were six
years old, what did you want to be?

318
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:44,239
- Fireman?
- Astronaut.

319
00:21:44,241 --> 00:21:47,608
Yeah? So what are you still
doing down here on earth?

320
00:21:54,902 --> 00:21:58,707
I think I internalized at a
young age that I was special.

321
00:21:58,709 --> 00:22:01,918
That I had the potential to do
something important in the world.

322
00:22:03,626 --> 00:22:06,167
And I've never really
let go of that idea.

323
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:13,874
One too many attaboys, huh?

324
00:22:13,876 --> 00:22:18,876
All right. All right. Now,
we're getting someplace.

325
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:24,998
Thank you for seeing me, Senator Thrush.

326
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,634
Reuel Abbott is a very powerful man.

327
00:22:28,636 --> 00:22:31,040
I understand your concern.

328
00:22:31,042 --> 00:22:33,776
I don't imagine there are many
people who have seen his dark side...

329
00:22:33,778 --> 00:22:35,373
... and are willing to talk about it.

330
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:38,542
Reuel has been operating
out of bounds for far too long.

331
00:22:38,544 --> 00:22:41,043
The American people deserve
to know the truth about anyone

332
00:22:41,045 --> 00:22:43,113
we entrust with such awesome power.

333
00:22:43,115 --> 00:22:46,290
I want to show you that I will
do everything within my power...

334
00:22:46,292 --> 00:22:49,167
to protect you from the
possibility of retribution.

335
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:52,203
But if it's too much for you,

336
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:55,707
if you need more time,
you're having doubts...

337
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:57,794
I don't want to pressure
you into saying something,

338
00:22:57,796 --> 00:22:59,499
you're not ready to say.

339
00:22:59,501 --> 00:23:02,591
No... I'm ready.

340
00:23:05,501 --> 00:23:07,499
Well?

341
00:23:07,501 --> 00:23:10,280
You know, I have been to every lot
between here and Baltimore...

342
00:23:10,282 --> 00:23:12,373
looking for this exact ambulance.

343
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:14,874
It was just used in a bank heist movie.

344
00:23:14,876 --> 00:23:17,323
- Oh yeah? What was the name of the film?
- I don't remember.

345
00:23:17,325 --> 00:23:19,331
You don't remember the name
of the guy who rented it from you?

346
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:23,040
I maintain strict confidentiality
with all my customers.

347
00:23:23,042 --> 00:23:25,190
So, what's your film all about?

348
00:23:26,432 --> 00:23:28,612
Oh, I'm not making a movie.

349
00:23:37,626 --> 00:23:40,665
Neither was the guy
that rented this from you.

350
00:23:40,667 --> 00:23:45,792
Movies use blanks. This
was used for something else.

351
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:51,717
If you give me the renter's information,

352
00:23:51,719 --> 00:23:54,709
your part in this ends here.

353
00:25:06,709 --> 00:25:09,584
I didn't question Sam's
death until Iris came along.

354
00:25:09,586 --> 00:25:10,959
Iris Loramer?

355
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:16,457
She told me that Sam was involved
in the death of her husband

356
00:25:16,459 --> 00:25:20,339
and she had proof.
She'd filmed them together.

357
00:25:20,341 --> 00:25:21,659
I saw it.

358
00:25:21,661 --> 00:25:23,803
My husband who I thought I knew

359
00:25:23,805 --> 00:25:25,417
ordering the death
of one of our friends.

360
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:31,256
I know that you've seen it.
Now I'd like you to unsee it.

361
00:25:31,258 --> 00:25:33,540
Go get it for me. Put it in my hand.

362
00:25:33,542 --> 00:25:37,040
Once you accused me
of threatening your family.

363
00:25:37,042 --> 00:25:41,081
At that time it was the
furthest thing from my mind.

364
00:25:41,083 --> 00:25:45,582
- So you gave it to him... the media card?
- What else could I do?

365
00:25:45,584 --> 00:25:48,183
They can kill you and
make it look like an accident.

366
00:25:50,501 --> 00:25:53,894
I know that I shouldn't
have given it to him.

367
00:25:53,896 --> 00:25:56,373
I was just so scared.

368
00:25:56,375 --> 00:25:57,938
You did the right thing at the time...

369
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:00,751
and you're doing the right thing now.

370
00:26:08,751 --> 00:26:11,415
It's Tracy. Leave a message.

371
00:26:11,417 --> 00:26:13,617
It's me. I've found the ambulance.

372
00:26:13,619 --> 00:26:15,712
I've got the guy's address
and I'm on my way there.

373
00:26:15,714 --> 00:26:16,714
Call me back.

374
00:26:30,873 --> 00:26:32,849
How long have you been married?

375
00:26:35,667 --> 00:26:38,015
Oh, I love it here!

376
00:26:38,017 --> 00:26:42,040
I found this cute little bazaar,
and then Anders...

377
00:26:42,042 --> 00:26:43,762
What are you doing?

378
00:26:44,698 --> 00:26:49,782
I just realized... that
Anders is asleep.

379
00:26:51,459 --> 00:26:53,634
So, what? You don't want
to hear about my day?

380
00:26:53,636 --> 00:26:57,165
Oh, no, no, no. I'm very
good at multi-tasking.

381
00:26:57,167 --> 00:27:02,001
Tell me... about that bazaar.

382
00:27:13,167 --> 00:27:15,584
Sorry.

383
00:27:23,959 --> 00:27:28,457
Have you ever noticed that all NFL
quarterbacks could be models?

384
00:27:28,459 --> 00:27:31,394
No, but I'm guessing that you've
got a theory on the subject.

385
00:27:31,396 --> 00:27:36,232
Great leaders are not born.
They're made.

386
00:27:36,234 --> 00:27:39,852
Okay. They are bred with
years of confidence-building,

387
00:27:39,854 --> 00:27:41,665
starting all the way
back at the playground.

388
00:27:41,667 --> 00:27:43,832
How many times have you
heard the sentence growing up...

389
00:27:43,834 --> 00:27:49,123
"You're going to be a
heart-breaker, Tracy". Right?

390
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:55,415
That sense of specialness... that
you internalized in your youth.

391
00:27:55,417 --> 00:27:57,619
That's a self-fulfilling prophecy.

392
00:27:57,621 --> 00:28:00,421
It's the same shit that
they said to Tom Brady.

393
00:28:01,709 --> 00:28:03,375
An interesting theory.

394
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:09,692
Okay, I got to take a piss.

395
00:28:23,479 --> 00:28:25,120
Baby, come here.

396
00:28:28,918 --> 00:28:31,083
Where we going?

397
00:28:32,125 --> 00:28:35,832
- I'm leaving Athens.
- Wh-Why?

398
00:28:35,834 --> 00:28:39,306
Because you're a fucking shit!

399
00:28:39,308 --> 00:28:41,667
That came in the mail today.

400
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:50,876
- Baby...
- Fucking asshole.

401
00:28:59,509 --> 00:29:03,368
- I thought you were married.
- Huh?

402
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:05,713
They sent us a copy.

403
00:29:06,959 --> 00:29:09,042
They send one to your wife?

404
00:29:11,834 --> 00:29:14,918
Fucking Russians, man. I am sorry.

405
00:29:16,083 --> 00:29:18,417
- Russians?
- She was a honey pot.

406
00:29:19,751 --> 00:29:23,832
I thought you were slick.
I thought you were Tom Brady.

407
00:29:23,834 --> 00:29:25,250
Did she leave you?

408
00:29:27,501 --> 00:29:29,210
Went back to Virginia.

409
00:29:29,212 --> 00:29:30,765
Well, you won't be too far behind her,

410
00:29:30,767 --> 00:29:32,299
so maybe you'll want her back.

411
00:29:32,301 --> 00:29:33,414
What?

412
00:29:33,416 --> 00:29:35,862
Your flight leaves at 8 AM tomorrow.

413
00:29:35,864 --> 00:29:38,319
Pack what you need. I'll have
the rest shipped over to you.

414
00:29:38,321 --> 00:29:39,764
- No. I don't understand.
- C'mon man.

415
00:29:39,766 --> 00:29:44,945
You're a smart guy. We're
taking you off the field.

416
00:29:51,427 --> 00:29:53,334
You've had a pretty mediocre career.

417
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:57,684
Things didn't go exactly as planned,

418
00:29:57,686 --> 00:29:59,631
but that doesn't make me traitor.

419
00:29:59,633 --> 00:30:02,019
But taking money from
a Russian asset does.

420
00:30:02,021 --> 00:30:03,025
Lior played me.

421
00:30:03,027 --> 00:30:05,832
No, I bet my career that you're dirty.

422
00:30:05,834 --> 00:30:07,364
I thought he was just ex-Mossad,

423
00:30:07,366 --> 00:30:10,667
I didn't know shit
about Russia. He said...

424
00:30:11,751 --> 00:30:15,706
He said I was the business
partner he was looking for. He...

425
00:30:15,708 --> 00:30:19,228
He stroked my ego. I fell for it. I...

426
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:22,540
- I needed the money.
- We all need the money.

427
00:30:22,542 --> 00:30:24,874
- You have to believe me.
- No.

428
00:30:24,876 --> 00:30:30,457
You have to convince me. And
you are not very convincing.

429
00:30:30,459 --> 00:30:33,251
Frankly, the only part I'm
having a hard time believing

430
00:30:33,253 --> 00:30:36,332
is how anybody can be such a loser.

431
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,250
Fuck you, Robin.

432
00:30:47,334 --> 00:30:52,749
- You okay?
- Sorry, Gordon is a friend.

433
00:30:52,751 --> 00:30:56,248
No apology necessary. It's...

434
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:59,918
Never easy to learn that a friend
isn't who you thought they were.

435
00:31:28,345 --> 00:31:35,365
_

436
00:33:18,667 --> 00:33:21,000
Matty? Open up.

437
00:33:30,042 --> 00:33:31,876
Matty?

438
00:33:37,501 --> 00:33:39,501
Fuck!

439
00:33:41,542 --> 00:33:43,459
Fuck!

440
00:34:31,859 --> 00:34:33,997
You were there that day.
You were in the car with him.

441
00:34:33,999 --> 00:34:35,165
I can explain.

442
00:34:35,167 --> 00:34:36,822
- The fuck you do?
- I can explain!

443
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:38,874
Why'd you kill Matty?

444
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:40,000
Because of the Russians?

445
00:34:40,002 --> 00:34:41,680
Because you guys
were working together...

446
00:34:41,682 --> 00:34:42,832
He's dead!

447
00:34:42,834 --> 00:34:45,142
- What?
- We didn't kill him.

448
00:34:45,144 --> 00:34:47,220
- We were gonna make a hand-off.
- Wait, wait, wait, What?

449
00:34:47,222 --> 00:34:49,094
You didn't... He's alive?!

450
00:34:49,096 --> 00:34:52,540
- We was gonna hand him over, man!
- To who? The Russians?

451
00:34:52,542 --> 00:34:55,567
The Russians? We
were working for the CIA.

452
00:34:55,569 --> 00:34:56,582
Who at the CIA?

453
00:34:56,584 --> 00:34:59,083
- You fucking with my head, man!
- I'm on your side.

454
00:34:59,085 --> 00:35:00,297
I'm on your side.

455
00:35:00,299 --> 00:35:02,516
And that's not such a good place
to be, 'cause everyone's dead!

456
00:35:02,518 --> 00:35:04,966
Hey. Calm down. You
need to hear me. Okay?

457
00:35:04,968 --> 00:35:06,499
I'm unarmed.

458
00:35:06,501 --> 00:35:09,253
Do you have any idea how
many unarmed men I've killed?

459
00:35:09,255 --> 00:35:11,392
One or two...

460
00:35:13,397 --> 00:35:16,100
Don't fucking move! Stay
on the fucking ground!

461
00:35:16,102 --> 00:35:18,332
I'm a federal agent.
My name is Joe Turner.

462
00:35:18,334 --> 00:35:20,043
Joe Turner?

463
00:35:20,045 --> 00:35:22,998
You were in the car with Sirin,
when that whole deal went down.

464
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,459
Dale Fridrych, FBI.

465
00:35:26,768 --> 00:35:29,830
I got a lead on Letts here.
An informant who said...

466
00:35:29,832 --> 00:35:32,207
him and his crew were
contracted to kill Sirin.

467
00:35:32,209 --> 00:35:35,248
What? No, not kill, kidnap.
And he got away.

468
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:37,451
- So, Sirin's alive?
- I-I think so.

469
00:35:37,453 --> 00:35:39,500
- Any idea where he is?
- No.

470
00:35:39,502 --> 00:35:40,780
You're bleeding.

471
00:35:40,782 --> 00:35:44,998
I got a first aid kit in my
truck. Hang here a minute.

472
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,334
What the fuck is going on?

473
00:35:57,102 --> 00:35:59,351
It's Tracy. Leave a message.

474
00:36:28,918 --> 00:36:33,874
I am impressed. Your little speech
brought Mr. Crane to tears.

475
00:36:33,876 --> 00:36:36,832
Tracy's too close to the case.

476
00:36:36,834 --> 00:36:39,408
He tried to persuade me
Gordon was being set up

477
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:41,557
by the Russians to
protect the real infiltrator.

478
00:36:41,559 --> 00:36:46,074
Tracy is a good man, and good
men like to think the best of others.

479
00:36:46,076 --> 00:36:47,818
Not like us.

480
00:37:32,012 --> 00:37:34,012
_

481
00:37:48,167 --> 00:37:49,959
Leave a message.

482
00:38:04,802 --> 00:38:07,284
Two dead guys. Our guy's
skull is cracked open.

483
00:38:07,286 --> 00:38:08,764
Probably a drug deal gone wrong.

484
00:38:08,766 --> 00:38:10,753
But, he's going on about
how we can't arrest him,

485
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:13,123
because he works for the government.

486
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:15,979
- Excuse me?
- Yes.

487
00:38:15,981 --> 00:38:18,129
I'm here for Joseph Turner.

488
00:38:18,131 --> 00:38:21,222
- You're his lawyer?
- No, I'm the deputy director of the CIA.

489
00:38:34,007 --> 00:38:37,725
I checked. There is no Dale
Fridrych working for the CIMC.

490
00:38:37,727 --> 00:38:39,159
The Russians are cleaning
up after themselves.

491
00:38:39,161 --> 00:38:40,195
What... cleaning up on?

492
00:38:40,197 --> 00:38:42,516
They set up Gordon to
protect their actual inside man.

493
00:38:42,518 --> 00:38:44,473
This whole fucking thing has
been one big active measure.

494
00:38:44,475 --> 00:38:46,386
If this is a disinformation campaign,

495
00:38:46,388 --> 00:38:49,290
you and Mrs. Larkin really
stepped into it, didn't you?

496
00:38:49,292 --> 00:38:51,876
No? What are you going to do now?

497
00:38:51,878 --> 00:38:54,248
Hmm?

498
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:56,537
Oh, if Sirin's alive
and you can find him,

499
00:38:56,539 --> 00:38:58,891
maybe he can tell you who the mole is.

500
00:38:58,893 --> 00:39:01,296
Too bad you didn't pick a
place to meet in the event,

501
00:39:01,298 --> 00:39:03,119
things didn't go as planned.

502
00:39:03,121 --> 00:39:04,121
Tradecraft?

503
00:39:04,123 --> 00:39:05,749
101.

504
00:39:05,751 --> 00:39:09,998
I'm not the only one who
made an obvious mistake.

505
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,707
Am I? You were in Bob's office,
the night that he died.

506
00:39:15,709 --> 00:39:17,752
Why didn't you go through his files?

507
00:39:17,754 --> 00:39:19,916
Maybe I was overcome by grief.

508
00:39:19,918 --> 00:39:23,751
Yeah, or maybe you have a reason
to hang Gordon Piper out to dry.

509
00:39:25,209 --> 00:39:27,209
Good night.

510
00:39:55,334 --> 00:39:57,709
- What can I get you?
- Bourbon. Neat.

511
00:40:08,584 --> 00:40:12,665
It makes sense that a man who
was once burned would fear fire.

512
00:40:12,667 --> 00:40:16,250
- Do we know each other?
- Of course I know you, Tracy.

513
00:40:17,667 --> 00:40:19,416
Sorry, I don't remember you.

514
00:40:19,418 --> 00:40:22,081
That's because we've never met.

515
00:40:22,083 --> 00:40:25,501
But I've been looking for someone
like you for a very long time.

516
00:40:26,868 --> 00:40:29,493
I think you mistake me for someone else.

517
00:40:31,083 --> 00:40:33,250
No, I don't think so.

518
00:40:37,474 --> 00:40:39,348
There you go.

519
00:40:54,014 --> 00:40:56,289
_

520
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:07,333
_

521
00:41:36,292 --> 00:41:38,667
I need to see you.

522
00:41:43,576 --> 00:41:45,501
Food time!

523
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:54,000
- Where's Dad?
- He's still at work. C'mon, let's eat.

524
00:43:01,876 --> 00:43:04,042
You've been crying, huh?

525
00:43:05,751 --> 00:43:08,000
Yeah, I've had a hell of a day, too.

526
00:43:09,334 --> 00:43:10,834
Thank you for coming.

527
00:43:26,982 --> 00:43:28,707
You and I should go away together.

528
00:43:28,709 --> 00:43:31,294
- When?
- Right now.

529
00:43:32,184 --> 00:43:35,434
- It's crazy... I can't.
- It makes perfect sense to me.

530
00:43:35,436 --> 00:43:37,246
We'll leave as soon as you're packed.

531
00:43:37,248 --> 00:43:42,198
I have children. Someone
has to drive them and feed them...

532
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,926
... and stand over them
when they do their homework.

533
00:43:44,928 --> 00:43:46,957
Ask your mom to look after them.

534
00:43:46,959 --> 00:43:51,207
- I've a shift tomorrow.
- Get another doctor to cover it.

535
00:43:51,209 --> 00:43:53,846
You just have an answer
for everything, huh?

536
00:43:53,848 --> 00:43:57,165
No, just us two things.

537
00:43:57,167 --> 00:43:59,673
If we leave right now, we
can be there before midnight.

538
00:43:59,675 --> 00:44:02,507
- Where?
- It's a surprise.

539
00:44:02,509 --> 00:44:04,944
Well then how would I know what to pack?

540
00:44:04,946 --> 00:44:06,657
Just bring one of everything.

541
00:44:24,235 --> 00:44:26,236
Attention.

542
00:44:26,238 --> 00:44:29,938
This is the boarding call for train...

543
00:45:09,834 --> 00:45:15,562
Joe? My name is Ekaterina.
My American friends call me Kat.

544
00:45:15,564 --> 00:45:17,364
We have a friend in common.

545
00:45:18,292 --> 00:45:19,721
Where is Vasili?

546
00:45:19,723 --> 00:45:20,724
He sent me.

547
00:45:20,726 --> 00:45:23,077
Let's get moving, so we don't
draw attention to ourselves.
