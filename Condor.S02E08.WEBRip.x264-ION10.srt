The overwatch team's in place, ma'am.

00:41:05,973 --> 00:41:09,194
<i>It was said that King
Solomon was especially fond</i>

643
00:41:09,196 --> 00:41:12,238
<i>of a loyal servant by the name of Ahiah.</i>

644
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,918
One day King Solomon entertained
the angel of death in his court.

645
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,351
And he noticed a strange
look on Death's face,

646
00:41:18,353 --> 00:41:20,800
when he saw Ahiah pouring wine.

647
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,198
<i>Later, when they were alone,
Solomon asked him about it</i>

648
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,158
<i>and Death admitted that he
had been surprised to see Ahiah</i>

649
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:33,038
<i>for he was on Death's
list for the very next day.</i>

650
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,511
Later that night,
when Death left the court,

651
00:41:35,513 --> 00:41:38,118
Solomon sent his servant away,

652
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,611
<i>insisting that he ride
all the way to Arabia</i>

653
00:41:40,613 --> 00:41:42,800
<i>to flee his date with Death.</i>

654
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,878
<i>That was the last time
Solomon saw Ahiah.</i>

655
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,598
<i>But the next time Solomon
saw the Angel of Death</i>

656
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,960
<i>Death told him a funny story.</i>

657
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,960
I am drunk.

659
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,516
I thought you said you
were never drinking again.

660
00:42:01,518 --> 00:42:02,596
I lied.

661
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:07,878
<i>He said he was surprised to see
Ahiah that day in Solomon's court</i>

662
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:11,840
<i>because he hadn't been expecting
to find the servant in Jerusalem.</i>

- That's great.

- Wow.
- Thank you.

I see you have no problem eating fish,

667
00:42:29,674 --> 00:42:31,278
when someone else catches it.

668
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,718
You've exposed my hypocrisy.

669
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,540
It must have been fun to
catch this big motherfucker.

(BOTH LAUGHING)

671
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,934
I think this is the biggest
fish I have ever seen.

00:42:41,936 --> 00:42:44,318
It's gigantic.

<i>The Angel of Death was surprised
to find Ahiah in Jerusalem...</i>

674
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:52,360
<i>because he had been planning to
meet him the next day in Arabia.</i>

675
00:42:55,593 --> 00:42:56,993
Mmm.

676
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:02,560
It's delicious. Are you going
to take a bite of that salmon?

677
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,360
Yeah, yeah.

678
00:43:08,192 --> 00:43:12,358
So, the wise king in trying to
help Ahiah escape his destiny

679
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,570
sends his favorite
servant to the very place,

680
00:43:14,572 --> 00:43:16,358
where Death was waiting for him.

681
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:19,198
I wonder what he did to
the servants he didn't like, hmm?

682
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,558
So, what does this story mean? Yeah?

683
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,480
It means...
