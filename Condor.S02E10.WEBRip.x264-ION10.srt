1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
What preceded:

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,360
Why all the trouble with Partridge
and Gordon if I'm not free?

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:09,280
Just tell me what to do.
 -Isn't that clear?

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,880
We are only safe
if it has been removed.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,280
You look like a corpse. You were already dead
if I hadn't helped you.

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,200
I don't listen to you.
 -Listen to yourself.

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,880
You were already dead
if I hadn't helped you.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,240
Help us if this works
to the Russian embassy.

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,520
We lure Volk to a safe place ...

10
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,160
we kidnap him and force him
to reveal the mole's identity.

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,120
Turner blackmails me.
He wants me to trap you.

12
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,400
Drop your charges.
 -Not now, Mae.

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,600
You had him picked up
because I spoke to Thrush.

14
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,240
I am really sorry.

15
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,000
Sorry to hear that.
 -So what they say about you Is true?

16
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,640
Mr. Abbott's not here, Mrs. Larkin.
 -He leaked that Piper story.

17
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:57,160
Why would he make us a bad name
for your benefit?

18
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,520
I find that scary.

19
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,800
Gordon, come on. To breathe.

20
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,760
You trust them
betray her own people?

21
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,960
I have no choice.
But that also applies to her.

22
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,200
I do what you asked.
 -Make sure you are available.

23
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,160
Where were you? I'm screwed.
 -By who?

24
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,760
Reuel, and the Russians.

25
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,240
Phoenix is ​​gone. Dead, I guess.

26
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,080
Give her time. She'll take it
get in touch as soon as she can.

27
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,120
I said "she," didn't I?

28
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,960
I have a place. Not a real safe house,
but good enough.

29
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,000
Okay, come on.

30
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,200
You're a good friend, Trace.

31
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,480
attract People to Eagle Lane 31

32
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,480
and then?
 -there He Is met

33
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,080
stupid plan

34
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:25,240
I'm here. They are not there yet.
I pretend to be at home.

35
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,560
What did he say?

36
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,320
I did not know
that we played hide and seek.

37
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,800
He gave me an address.
 -And?

38
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:02,920
That's all.
-He'll get you to a metal concert ...

39
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,720
to give you an address?

40
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,040
It was more punk.
 -But why?

41
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:14,880
Maybe he was scared of being on a lake
public place to fall into the trap.

42
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,640
Or he didn't want me to hear
what he said to you.

43
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,040
Or he doesn't want you to trust me.

44
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:26,200
If you can't understand us, you would
may think we are up to something.

45
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,880
Then that man is a genius.

46
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,400
After you.

47
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,400
How's the patient?

48
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,600
He has to rest that leg for a week.
 - Maybe another week.

49
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,080
Wouldn't you stop?
Then you live longer.

50
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,640
And all those stumpers that stop
and then die young?

51
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,400
Are you afraid of that?

52
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,480
That you die young?

53
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,800
My father also died young.
 -It was with the CIA.

54
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,680
I think I get it
how it went with Sam.

55
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,400
You can become so straightforward ...

56
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,680
in defending your principles ...

57
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,640
that you forget to follow them.

58
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,200
I think Sam lost out on that.

59
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,520
And you?

60
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,080
Have you lost yourself?
 -Not yet, I think.

61
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:24,680
I don't know what you and Trace are doing,
but please be careful.

62
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,440
Here.

63
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,840
Don't tell anyone.
 -I can keep secrets well.

64
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,080
Change does not mean
lose your identity.

65
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,400
Sometimes it means right
find your identity.

66
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,800
Shall we?

67
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,800
How do you feel?
 -Like the cheese in a mousetrap.

68
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,360
You're not the only one.

69
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,880
Hi, Paula.

70
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,800
No, why?

71
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,800
Eva?

72
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,240
I am so sorry.

73
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:50,720
What should I do?
 -Come on.

74
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,680
So this is a CIA safe house.

75
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:42,040
No. We don't yet know who the mole is,
so we can't trust them.

76
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,760
Who lives here then?

77
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,400
Nobody. The owner died
last week. No family.

78
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,160
Wait.

79
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:22,120
I've been watching the house.
They're in. Only.

80
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,640
Who was that?

81
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,760
Someone I asked to come earlier,
for the sake of my safety.

82
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,280
You mean our safety.

83
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,000
Yes, that's what I meant.

84
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,560
He said they're in there alone.

85
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,280
What are we waiting for?

86
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,400
You thought I did this
would do only with you?

87
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,040
The coast is clear.

88
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,840
The house is empty.

89
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,320
There is nobody.

90
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,520
You are a very good liar.

91
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,280
If you have been betrayed,
it wasn't me.

92
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:31,120
It is especially clever how you take care of it
that I believe you.

93
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,480
We have to hurry.

94
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,840
So those bad things I do online
read about you, are all correct?

95
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,720
Joe, he's coming to.

96
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,760
I remember you.
Clearly you remember me.

97
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,760
Or you think you know me.
I also knew myself.

98
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,280
What I was and was not capable of.

99
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,640
Torturing someone,
for any reason...

100
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:06,120
was always something that I consider myself
deemed unable.

101
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,360
Or could be part of it.

102
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,040
The trick is to take it one step at a time
to do.

103
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:21,800
Ask yourself: Where is the limit
what I don't want to get over

104
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,400
And then you move it.

105
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,320
A little piece.

106
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:35,080
And then you move it a little further.
And another piece.

107
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,680
Continuously.

108
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,200
Until you are the person you were
barely recognized.

109
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,800
So. Who is your mole?

110
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,280
So she chose you?

111
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,680
Dirty whore.

112
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,320
I think he is jealous.

113
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,600
Maybe he saw
how you took my cock in your mouth.

114
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,240
You have to take care in this business
that you keep your distance.

115
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:25,400
Then you are better prepared
on the possibility of treason.

116
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,240
I liked her, but she's still a whore.
It is pure business.

117
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,360
It can never be more with a whore.

118
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,280
Maybe we are all whores.

119
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,640
It is rare as someone
retains its honor in this business.

120
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,720
What kind of circus is this?
 -Give me a minute. Two minutes.

121
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,800
Your uncle, for example.
He was given a choice that evening.

122
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:57,880
Not by me, of course, but by
the man you are looking for.

123
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,200
Bob could choose: Must look it
as a suicide or as a raid?

124
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:07,880
But of course there was also an incursion
his wife be killed.

125
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,960
Your uncle went for the honorable choice.

126
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:31,160
Joe, that's enough.
 -Let me go.

127
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,680
Do not touch me.
 -Come to yourself.

128
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:57,280
Is everything alright?
 -I thought I could count on you.

129
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,160
Then you can too.
It just has to look good.

130
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,000
This was not our plan.

131
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,160
This is a new plan,
where we both get what we want.

132
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,800
This is going to be messy. We have to cut down,
he never lets go.

133
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:28,360
Not this way. He is trained
to endure a lot more.

134
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,360
What do you suggest?
 -Chop off his fingers.

135
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,360
When there are no more fingers,
make up something else.

136
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,080
What are you talking about?

137
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,960
Where are you going?

138
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,000
Give him some water.

139
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,680
We are torturing him.
 -I know how It works.

140
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,480
Brute force is not enough.

141
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,120
I want to try something different.
 -Leave her.

142
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,280
Water?
 -No.

143
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,160
I was already scared
that you would frame me.

144
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:36,040
I prepared for it,
and yet you did it.

145
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,360
Tell me.
How did you do it?

146
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:45,200
By not knowing what I was going to do
until the moment was there.

147
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,560
By just being true to myself.

148
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,720
You could do that too.

149
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:54,160
Adapt to the circumstances
and make sure you survive.

150
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,440
They'll make a deal with you.

151
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:02,000
Cigarette?
 -Go ahead.

152
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,080
I will not bite you.

153
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,240
First I am betrayed
by my best friend.

154
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,960
Then by a woman
for whom I got feelings.

155
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,120
I fell for it again.

156
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,680
I haven't played a game with you.

157
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:44,480
My feelings for you are real.
But I think it's too late for that now.

158
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,200
My grandfather was in Germany
during the occupation ...

159
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,440
after the Great Patriotic War.

160
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,840
He fell for a German beauty.

161
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:03,120
They had a child
and she also fell for him.

162
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,600
In that order.

163
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:13,360
Early in their relationship
love came from one side.

164
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:20,840
But pure love
defies logic ...

165
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,720
and all circumstances.

166
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:31,840
If I saw a future for us
I would tell them everything.

167
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,600
I'm tired of it, Katya.

168
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,880
Dear...

169
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,880
Who is it? Say it.

170
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,240
Tell me who it is. Who is it?

171
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,720
He is dead.

172
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,080
Piece of shit.

173
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,600
Sorry. I had rang the doorbell.
 -Carla.

174
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:36,000
I was with the director. Nobody above
GS-15 was at the CIMC office.

175
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:41,040
You're the only one on the seventh floor
who knows the details of the Piper case.

176
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,280
Now that he's dead ...

177
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:48,040
He committed suicide in his cell.
Now everyone wants information.

178
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,800
Why?
-If a CIA agent dies ...

179
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:55,800
Why did he commit suicide?
-As double spy unmasked ...

180
00:25:55,920 --> 00:26:00,160
But he was innocent.
He was not the mole.

181
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,800
How do you know that?
-I was in Bob's office that fateful night.

182
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:10,800
There was nothing to be found in his files. So
Gordon's file was put there later.

183
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:16,560
Why didn't you say anything?
 -I wanted to sabotage Robin Larkin.

184
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:23,880
So you knew there was another mole
walked around ...

185
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,920
that was a danger to our people,
and you said nothing because of a feud?

186
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,360
I suffered a long time
taken a wrong turn ...

187
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,520
and continued with that.

188
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:48,720
I'm afraid
that I have lost my way terribly.

189
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,600
I see your wound is already healing
comrade.

190
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,640
I have some questions for you
about that day.

191
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,560
How did you end up at that lake?

192
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,560
People traced Sirin
to a secluded house.

193
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:14,200
We lured Volk to the house
to separate him from his team.

194
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,640
You wanted it one on one?
 -He was with a woman.

195
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,120
We kidnapped them.

196
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,520
It was a trap.
They were waiting for us.

197
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,080
The woman escaped.

198
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,520
I escaped.
 -How?

199
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,160
They were torturing People.

200
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,240
We don't torture people.

201
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:37,000
Does he have the informant's name
given?

202
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:43,800
No.
 - Would He Give in under pressure?

203
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,040
No, I do not think so.

204
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,600
Where was Robin Larkin in this story?

205
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,400
I have her before Gordon's arrest
last seen.

206
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:57,640
How does her disappearance fit
altogether?

207
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,520
I think she was killed
to protect the mole.

208
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:05,000
But she disappeared
after Piper was arrested.

209
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:10,240
Unless you have reasons to suspect
that Piper was not the mole.

210
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:17,480
I think he was framed.
I don't know who the mole is.

211
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:38,880
I'm glad you're okay.
-Is everything alright? You weren't in the hospital.

212
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,600
I can not do it.

213
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,320
Not after Gordon.

214
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:53,520
I explained that.
 -you said everything Would be fine.

215
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,040
And I trusted you.

216
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,600
We were at their home
when you did that to him.

217
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,200
He was our friend.
 -I know.

218
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:10,720
But you don't have all the facts.
-That's right.

219
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,080
And you can't give me that either,
or?

220
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:18,240
That's why I was already cautious
towards you.

221
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,440
I've made that mistake before.

222
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,200
I would
that you had an idea ...

223
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:32,520
of the shit I had to do
to make it work between us.

224
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,320
Really, I wish you knew that.

225
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,880
Even more confidential bullshit.
-That's my job.

226
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,560
That is precisely the problem.

227
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,760
Had that figured out
before you misled me.

228
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:49,560
I think you did that yourself.
 - Get It on.

229
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,640
Out of my house.

230
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,680
Are you deaf?
 -everything fine?

231
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,080
Tracy just left.

232
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,720
Goodbye, Mr. Crane.

233
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,440
Goodbye, Mr. Crane.

234
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,240
Is everything alright?

235
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,040
Sorry.

236
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:27,240
Surprisingly, the Deputy Director of
the CIA at a traitor's funeral.

237
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,520
We both know that Gordon doesn't
was a traitor. The CIA also knows ...

238
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:35,760
but they never admit that.
I've been to funerals before ...

239
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,360
of people before whose death
I felt responsible.

240
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:43,080
But I am determined
make sure this is the last one.

241
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:49,040
And if I'm committed to you
to kill? To be sure?

242
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,200
You get a taste for it, Joe.
Watch out.

243
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:58,840
But I'm going to retire and plan to
make a full confession.

244
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,440
We cannot do anything
with what is between you and your god.

245
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:09,760
That's why I intend to use it
to make a more public forum.

246
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,520
Take care of yourself, Joe.

247
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,880
Capitol Hill is getting ready ...

248
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,360
for the testimony
from CIA CEO Reuel Abbott.

249
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,120
Is everything alright?

250
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:46,000
The focus will be on the allegations
from former CIA agent Marty Frost.

251
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:52,640
Even if Abbott only a part
of the Frost file confirms ...

252
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:57,160
that could have major implications for
the US intelligence services.

253
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,120
For more on Abbott's testimony
we go to the Capitol.

254
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,760
I will not scream.

255
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,320
I know.

256
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:45,120
Hey everything okay?
 -Reuel Abbott Is dead.

257
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,080
Turn on the TV.

258
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,440
Wait a second.

259
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:00,520
It has just been confirmed that CIA CEO
Reuel Abbott has been found dead ...

260
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,840
in his pool.
The police investigation is still ongoing.

261
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,400
I will call you back.

262
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,080
All kinds of theories are circulating
about the suspicious timing ...

263
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,280
just before Abbott's testimony
for Congress.

264
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,960
Say goodbye, Mr. Crane.

265
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,040
Bastards.
 -Congratulations.

266
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,960
Well deserved.
-We're going to miss you.

267
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,280
Hey, I think I got a bite.

268
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,760
To catch up.

269
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,080
A big.
 -We can eat that.

270
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,120
We keep it.
 -Kiss.

271
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,600
Gatver, Dad.
 -Look.

272
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,480
Super. I am a real fisherman.
 -Well done.

273
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:01,720
I am not armed.
-You can't be too careful.

274
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,520
Can I sit with you?

275
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,720
Surprised to see me?

276
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,400
No. After what we've been through ...

277
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:19,840
we are both an interesting recruit
for the other.

278
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:23,080
If you hadn't approached me,
I had approached you.

279
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:30,560
I don't have to recruit you, Potoo.
 -Do I have to understand what that means?

280
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:35,080
I recognized your voice by the lake.
I just couldn't remember what.

281
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:39,400
Suddenly I knew. I was in the car
that night when you called Volk ...

282
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,000
to say Joe
was on the way to Vasili.

283
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:46,320
You are just like me.
You play for both teams.

284
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,720
You were a Folk man in the safe house, huh?

285
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,120
The one he just counted on.

286
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:57,480
You untied it.
And you shot, so you were the hero.

287
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:03,160
How far-fetched.
It seems like the spy novel.

288
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:09,160
Played very cleverly.
I would have done the same.

289
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,080
If what you say is true ...

290
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,560
we both have something where we
to pick up the other.

291
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:23,040
Then we are still ...
 -Even? Exactly what I thought myself.

292
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,440
What are you doing here?

293
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,240
I am back with the SVR.
I want to know if my secret is safe.

294
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:33,000
Well?
 -I have stopped.

295
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,920
At the CIA.
 -No, with everything.

296
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,560
So you will no longer report
to Moscow?

297
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,320
Beautiful.

298
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,680
Have a nice life.

299
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,400
What are you doing here?

300
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,560
I have thought a lot about this house.
 -Yes? how so?

301
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:56,760
How long you have it
and how much it must have cost you.

302
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:05,160
How long have you been doing this?
 -what are you talking about?

303
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,600
I have stopped.
 - At the CIA.

304
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,120
No, with everything.

305
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,880
So you will no longer report
to Moscow?

306
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,160
That was a game.
I wanted to recruit her as an informant.

307
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:26,720
You were only late.
She is now my informant.

308
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:31,960
She is a Russian spy. Do you believe...
-She's very convincing.

309
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:36,200
This is what they do. They are good at it.
They did it with Gordon, and now ...

310
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,880
It's what you do.

311
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,920
So you have already decided.

312
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:52,360
You always talk, don't you?

313
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,640
People are often outside the city
good of confidence.

314
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,040
They don't lock their door
and have no alarm.

315
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:10,360
You just wanted to shoot me?
-Isn't that what you did to Bob?

316
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:20,840
I made up my mind to tell you quietly
what I was going to do to you.

317
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,320
Give you the chance to have your say.

318
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,720
I wanted you to know
that this was not revenge ...

319
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,120
but justice.

320
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:35,280
But you know, I lied to myself.

321
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:42,080
Because what I really want,
is seeing that look in your eyes ...

322
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,600
when you realize it's over.

323
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:20,880
I've heard stories about what's going on
happened at the lake. Is it true?

324
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,800
Depends what you heard.

325
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,520
I was friends with Tracy Crane.

326
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:35,160
He was one of the good guys.
Unbelievable that he is no longer there.

327
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:40,240
Do you want to know what I heard?
 -what have you heard?

328
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:45,080
It was revenge from the Russians
for Gordon Piper.

329
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,040
For revealing their mole.

330
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:54,920
After you.

331
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,840
CIA headquarters, Virginia

332
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:24,520
Last year we focused all our attention
on Boko Haram and IS in West Africa.

333
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,720
We have shifted our focus
to a new game.

334
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:30,560
We now play chess with the Chinese
and Africa is the sign.

335
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:34,720
Half of this room is busy ours
to strengthen its military position there.

336
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:39,040
The other half tries to prevent
that the Chinese do the same.

337
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:42,920
A dirty game,
but it's us or them, right?

338
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:47,840
I sit there. Just scream
if you want to smoke.
